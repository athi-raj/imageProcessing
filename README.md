# Project Title

📌 Overview

This project demonstrates various image processing techniques using Python and OpenCV, including image reading, displaying, transformations, morphological operations, and feature extraction.


🛠️ Technologies Used

* Python 

* OpenCV 

* Matplotlib 

* NumPy 


🚀 Features

* Read and display an image 

* Write text on an image 

* Crop a part of an image 

* Crop the center of an image 

* Rotate and resize an image 

* Draw text strings on images 

* Convert between color spaces (LAB, YCrCb) 

* Perform morphological transformations (Erosion, Dilation) 

* Extract image features using histograms 

* Compute mean RGB intensity 

* Intensity-invariant image processing 

Google Colab provides virtual RAM and disk storage, so you can run this project without needing a high-end PC. Simply upload the script and images, and start experimenting online!

Tip: If working with large images, go to Runtime > Change runtime type in Colab and select High RAM for better performance.
